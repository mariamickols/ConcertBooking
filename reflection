- Three things we enjoyed this week (techniques)

--> dud: test framework
--> It was nice and pedagogical to improve our calculator step-by-step
--> Fun with group assignment, it was good size on the group to make 'one component'



- Three things you would like to investigate more

--> Understand how JavaScript fits in the bigger picture, e.g. how it works in 'real
    life' with for example Java applications?
--> Suggestion, how to dive deeper into JavaScript, Where to find more material
--> See real life examples (with code), how are major websites actually using JavaScript?
